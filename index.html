<h2 id="thoughts-on-the-book">Thoughts on the Book</h2>
<p>For some reason, Axler’s approach to linear algebra is polarizing, with many praising the book’s more abstract approach and others criticizing it for his decision to defer use of the determinant until the end of the book.</p>
<p>I happen to enjoy this style, and I think it really streamlines the presentation of linear algebra pedagogically.&nbsp But I also understand this might not suit everyone’s taste, and two good alternatives are the excellent books by <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Hoffman-Linear-Algebra-2nd-Edition/PGM52361.html">Hoffman &amp; Kunze</a> and <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Friedberg-Linear-Algebra-5th-Edition/PGM1939358.html">Friedberg et al</a>.</p>
<p>It probably goes without saying, but this is not an appropriate book for a first encounter with linear algebra.&nbsp The material won’t stick unless you’ve studied the subject from the perspective of, e.g., <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">Gilbert Strang’s book</a> (which approaches linear algebra from a more applied point-of-view and is also a great book). </p>

<p>The problems are, on the whole, excellent.&nbsp However, a future edition might do well to trim some of the fat.&nbsp Earlier editions of the book had fewer problems, but they were all well-chosen.</p>
