\section{Inner Products and Norms}

% Problem 1
\begin{problem}{1}
Show that the function that takes $\left((x_1,x_2), (y_1,y_2)\right)\in \R^2\times \R^2$ to $\Mod{x_1y_1} + \Mod{x_2y_2}$ is not an inner product on $\R^2$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose it were.  First notice
\begin{align*}
\inp{(1, 1) + (-1, -1)}{(1, 1)} &= \inp{(0, 0)}{(1, 1)}\\
&= \Mod{0\cdot 1} + \Mod{0\cdot 1}\\
&= 0.
\end{align*}
Next, since inner products are additive in the first slot, we also have
\begin{align*}
\inp{(1, 1) + (-1, -1)}{(1, 1)} &= \inp{(1, 1)}{(1, 1)} + \inp{(-1, -1)}{(1, 1)}\\
&= \Mod{1\cdot 1} + \Mod{1 \cdot 1} + \Mod{(-1)\cdot 1} + \Mod{(-1) \cdot 1}\\
&= 4.
\end{align*}
But this implies $0 = 4$, a contradiction.  Hence we must conclude that the function does not in fact define an inner product.
\end{proof}

% Problem 3
\begin{problem}{3}
Suppose $\F=\R$ and $V\neq \{0\}$.  Replace the positivity condition (which states that $\inp{v}{v}\geq0$ for all $v\in V$) in the definition of an inner product (6.3) with the condition that $\inp{v}{v} > 0$ for some $v\in V$.  Show that this change in the definition does not change the set of functions from $V\times V$ to $\R$ that are inner products on $V$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be a nontrivial vector space over $\R$, let $A$ denote the set of functions $V\times V\to\R$ that are inner products on $V$ in the standard definition, and let $B$ denote the set of functions $V\times V\to \R$ under the modified definition.  We will show $A = B$.\\
\indent Suppose $\inp{\cdot}{\cdot}_1\in A$.  Since $V\neq\{0\}$, there exists $v\in V-\{0\}$.  Then $\inp{v}{v}_1>0$, and so $\inp{\cdot}{\cdot}_1\in B$.  Thus $A\subseteq B$.\\ 
\indent Conversely, suppose $\inp{\cdot}{\cdot}_2 \in B$.  Then there exists some $v'\in V$ such that $\inp{v'}{v'}_2 > 0$.  Suppose by way of contradiction there exists $u\in V$ is such that $\inp{u}{u}_2 < 0$.  Define $w = \alpha u + (1- \alpha) v'$ for $\alpha\in\R$.  It follows
\begin{align*}
\inp{w}{w}_2 &= \inp{\alpha u + (1- \alpha) v'}{\alpha u + (1- \alpha) v'}_2\\
&= \inp{\alpha u}{\alpha u}_2 + 2\inp{\alpha u}{(1 - \alpha)v'}_2 + \inp{(1 - \alpha)v'}{(1 - \alpha)v'}_2\\
&= \alpha^2\inp{u}{u}_2 + 2\alpha(1-\alpha)\inp{u}{v'}_2 + (1-\alpha)^2\inp{v'}{v'}_2.
\end{align*}
Notice the final expression is a polynomial in the indeterminate $\alpha$, call it $p$.  Since $p(0) = \inp{v'}{v'}_2 > 0$ and $p(1) = \inp{u}{u}_2 < 0$, by Bolzano's theorem there exists $\alpha_0\in(0, 1)$ such that $p(\alpha_0) = 0$.  That is, if $ w = \alpha_0u + (1 - \alpha_0)v'$, then $\inp{w}{w}_2 = 0$.  In particular, notice $\alpha_0\neq 0$, for otherwise $w = v'$, a contradiction since $\inp{v'}{v'}_2 > 0$.  Now, since $\inp{w}{w}_2 = 0$ iff $w = 0$ (by the definiteness condition of an inner product), it follows 
\begin{equation*}
u = \frac{\alpha_0 - 1}{\alpha_0} v.
\end{equation*}
Letting $t =  \frac{\alpha_0 - 1}{\alpha_0}$, we now have
\begin{align*}
\inp{u}{u}_2 &= \inp{tv'}{tv'}_2\\
&= t^2\inp{v'}{v'}_2\\
&> 0,
\end{align*}
where the inequality follows since $t\in(-1, 0)$ and $\inp{v'}{v'}_2 > 0$.  This contradicts our assumption that $\inp{u}{u}_2 < 0$, and so we have $\inp{\cdot}{\cdot}_2\in A$.  Therefore, $B\subseteq A$.  Since we've already shown $A\subseteq B$, this implies $A = B$, as desired.
\end{proof}

% Problem 5
\begin{problem}{5}
Let $V$ be finite-dimensional.  Suppose $T\in\Hom(V)$ is such that $\Norm{Tv}\leq \Norm{v}$ for every $v\in V$.  Prove that $T-\sqrt{2}I$ is invertible.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $v\in\Null(T - \sqrt{2}I)$, and suppose by way of contradiction that $v\neq 0$.  Then
\begin{align*}
Tv - \sqrt{2}v = 0 &\implies Tv = \sqrt{2}v\\
&\implies \Norm{\sqrt{2}v}\leq \Norm{v}\\
&\implies \sqrt{2}\cdot \Norm{v}\leq \Norm{v}\\
&\implies \sqrt{2} \leq 1,
\end{align*}
a contradiction.  Hence $v = 0$ and $\Null(T - \sqrt{2}I) =\{0\}$, so that $T-\sqrt{2}I$ is injective.  Since $V$ is finite-dimensional, this implies $T-\sqrt{2}I$ is invertible, as desired.
\end{proof}

% Problem 7
\begin{problem}{7}
Suppose $u,v\in V$.  Prove that $\Norm{au + bv} = \Norm{bu + av}$ for all $a,b\in\R$ if and only if $\Norm{u} = \Norm{v}$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $\Norm{au + bv} = \Norm{bu + av}$ for all $a,b\in\R$.  Then this equation holds when $a = 1$ and $b = 0$.  But then we must have $\Norm{u} = \Norm{v}$, as desired.\\
\indent $(\Leftarrow)$ Conversely, suppose $\Norm{u} = \Norm{v}$.  Let $a,b\in\R$ be arbitrary, and notice
\begin{align}
\Norm{au + bv} &= \inp{au + bv}{au + bv} \nonumber \\
&= \inp{au}{au} + \inp{au}{bv} + \inp{bv}{au} + \inp{bv}{bv} \nonumber \\
&= a^2\Norm{u}^2 + ab\left(\inp{u}{v} + \inp{v}{u}\right) + b^2\Norm{v}^2. \label{eq1}
\end{align}
Also, we have
\begin{align}
\Norm{bu + av} &= \inp{bu + av}{bu + av} \nonumber \\
&= \inp{bu}{bu} + \inp{bu}{av} + \inp{av}{bu} + \inp{av}{av} \nonumber \\
&= b^2\Norm{u}^2 + ab\left(\inp{u}{v} + \inp{v}{u}\right) + a^2\Norm{v}^2. \label{eq2}
\end{align}
Since $\Norm{u} = \Norm{v}$, \eqref{eq1} equals \eqref{eq2}, and hence $\Norm{au + bv} = \Norm{bu + av}$.  Since $a,b$ were arbitrary, the result follows.
\end{proof}

% Problem 9
\begin{problem}{9}
Suppose $u,v\in V$ and $\Norm{u}\leq 1$ and $\Norm{v}\leq 1$.  Prove that 
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{1 - \Norm{u}^2}\sqrt{1 - \Norm{v}^2}\leq 1 - \Mod{\inp{u}{v}}.
\end{equation*}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have $\Mod{\inp{u}{v}}\leq \Norm{u}\Norm{v}$.  Since $\Norm{u}\leq 1$ and $\Norm{v}\leq 1$, this implies
\begin{align*}
0 \leq 1 -\Norm{u}\Norm{v} \leq 1 -\Mod{\inp{u}{v}},
\end{align*}
and hence it's enough to show
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{1 - \Norm{u}^2}\sqrt{1 - \Norm{v}^2} \leq 1 -\Norm{u}\Norm{v}.
\end{equation*}
Squaring both sides, it suffices to prove 
\begin{equation}
\left(1 - \Norm{u}^2\right)\left(1 - \Norm{v}^2\right) \leq \left(1 -\Norm{u}\Norm{v}\right)^2. \label{eq3}
\end{equation}
Notice
\begin{align*}
\left(1 -\Norm{u}\Norm{v}\right)^2 - \left(1 - \Norm{u}^2\right)\left(1 - \Norm{v}^2\right) &= \Norm{u}^2 - 2\Norm{u}\Norm{v} + \Norm{v}^2\\
&= \left(\Norm{u} - \Norm{v}\right)^2\\
&\geq 0,
\end{align*}
and hence inequality \eqref{eq3} holds, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

% Problem 11
\begin{problem}{11}
Prove that
\begin{equation*}
16 \leq (a + b + c + d)\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}\right)
\end{equation*}
for all positive numbers $a,b,c,d$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Define
\begin{align*}
x = \left(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{b}, \sqrt{c}, \sqrt{d} \right)\quad\text{and}\quad y = \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{a}}, \sqrt{\frac{1}{b}}, \sqrt{\frac{1}{c}}, \sqrt{\frac{1}{d}}\right).
\end{align*}
Then the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality implies
\begin{align*}
(a + b + c + d)\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}\right) &\geq \left|\sqrt{a}\sqrt{\frac{1}{a}} + \sqrt{b}\sqrt{\frac{1}{b}} + \sqrt{c}\sqrt{\frac{1}{c}} + \sqrt{d}\sqrt{\frac{1}{d}}\right|^2\\
&= \left|1 + 1 + 1 + 1\right|^2\\
&= 16,
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}

% Problem 13
\begin{problem}{13}
Suppose $u,v$ are nonzero vectors in $\R^2$.  Prove that
\begin{equation*}
\inp{u}{v} = \Norm{u}\Norm{v}\cos\theta,
\end{equation*}
where $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$ (thinking of $u$ and $v$ as arrows with initial point at the origin).
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $A$ denote the line segment from the origin to $u$, let $B$ denote the line segment from the origin to $v$, and let $C$ denote the line segment from $v$ to $u$.  Then $A$ has length $\Norm{u}$, $B$ has length $\Norm{v}$ and $C$ has length $\Norm{u - v}$.  Letting $\theta$ denote the angle between $A$ and $B$, by the Law of Cosines we have
\begin{align*}
C^2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2BC\cos\theta,
\end{align*} 
or equivalently
\begin{align*}
\Norm{u - v}^2 = \Norm{u}^2 + \Norm{v}^2 - 2\Norm{u}\Norm{v}\cos\theta.
\end{align*}
It follows
\begin{align*}
2\Norm{u}\Norm{v}\cos\theta &= \Norm{u}^2 + \Norm{v}^2 - \Norm{u-v}^2\\
&= \inp{u}{u} + \inp{v}{v} - \inp{u-v}{u-v}\\
&= \inp{u}{u} + \inp{v}{v} - \left(\inp{u}{u} - 2\inp{u}{v} + \inp{v}{v}\right)\\
&= 2\inp{u}{v}.
\end{align*}
Dividing both sides by $2$ gives the desired result.
\end{proof}

% Problem 15
\begin{problem}{15}
Prove that 
\begin{equation*}
\left(\sum_{j = 1}^na_j b_j\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{j = 1}^nj{a_j}^2\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^n\frac{{b_j}^2}{j}\right)
\end{equation*}
for all real numbers $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and $b_1,\dots,b_n$.
\end{problem}
