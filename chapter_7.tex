% Problem 1
\begin{problem}{1}
Suppose $n$ is a positive integer.  Define $T\in\Hom(\F^n)$ by
\begin{align*}
T(z_1, \dots, z_n) = (0, z_1, \dots, z_{n-1}).
\end{align*}
Find a formula for $T^\ast(z_1,\dots, z_n)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Fix $(y_1,\dots, y_n)\in\F^n$.  Then for all $(z_1,\dots, z_n)\in \F^n$, we have
\begin{align*}
\inp{(z_1,\dots, z_n)}{T^\ast(y_1,\dots, y_n)} &= \inp{T(z_1,\dots, z_n)}{(y_1,\dots, y_n)}\\
&= \inp{(0, z_1,\dots, z_{n-1})}{(y_1,\dots, y_n)}\\
&= z_1y_2 + z_2y_3 + \dots + z_{n-1}y_n\\
&=\inp{(z_1,\dots, z_{n-1}, z_n)}{(y_2, \dots, y_n, 0)}.
\end{align*}
Thus $T^*$ is the left-shift operator.  That is, for all $(z_1,\dots, z_n)\in \F^n$, we have
\begin{align*}
T^\ast(z_1,\dots, z_n) = (z_2, \dots, z_n, 0),
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}
