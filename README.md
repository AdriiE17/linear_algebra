## Thoughts on the Book

For some reason, Axler's approach to linear algebra is polarizing, with many praising the book's more abstract approach and others criticizing it for his decision to defer use of the determinant until the end of the book. 

I happen to enjoy this style, and I think it really streamlines the presentation of linear algebra pedagogically.  But I also understand the perspective of critics, and two good alternatives are the excellent books by [Hoffman & Kunze](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Hoffman-Linear-Algebra-2nd-Edition/PGM52361.html) and [Friedberg et al](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Friedberg-Linear-Algebra-5th-Edition/PGM1939358.html). 

It probably goes without saying, but this is not an appropriate book for a first encounter with linear algebra.  The material won't stick unless you've studied the subject from the perspective of, e.g., [Gilbert Strang's book](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/) (which approaches linear algebra from a more applied point-of-view and is also a great book).

## Thoughts on the Problems

The problems are, on the whole, excellent.  However, a future edition might do well to trim some of the fat.  Earlier editions of the book had fewer problems, but they were all well-chosen.
